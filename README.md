# Helping Amazon Prime

## Chandrashekhar G. Ranade
Britta has approached our consultancy firm to help her create an automated pipeline for Amazon Prime
that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables.
We have already done a lot of work for this and so it will be possible to help Britta. We have four deliverables as follows:

Deliverable 1: Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files
Deliverable 2: Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data
Deliverable 3: Extract and Transform the Kaggle data
Deliverable 4: Create the Movie Database

 The whole project is important for our company since once we have satisfied out client Britta, we hope to get many more such project. Now we are submitting our work to Britta.
